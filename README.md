Hello!

This is a very basic resource that should be used as a replacement for base-game GTA vehicles and **removes the bump/curb boosting bug** from each.

Through adding the advanced flag 8000000 (CF_USE_DOWNFORCE_BIAS), it changes the way downforce works on each vehicle and by proxy removes speed gained by going over bumps and curbs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is still **WIP**, there are a few vehicles that don't work (i.e. ones with hydraulics) and there are a few errors.

The handling of vehicles has also been changed to be more realistic. If you wish to return them to their base state, absolutely feel free.

I don't ask for any credit, I just thought it might be worth sharing to the world.
